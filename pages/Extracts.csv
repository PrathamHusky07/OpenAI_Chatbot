This information, provided to entities undergoing examination or inspection, should help entities to understand better the staff's objectives in this area.1**\n\nFootnote 1: This statement represents the views of staff of EXAMS. It is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the Commission. The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content. This statement, like all staff statements, has no legal force or effect: it does not alter or amend applicable law, and it creates no new or additional obligations for any person.\n\n**I.****PURPOSE OF EXAMINATIONS**\n\nCommission representatives have statutory authority to conduct, at any time or from time to time, reasonable periodic, special, and other examinations of the records of specified Commission-regulated entities (entity or entities). The staff carries out these responsibilities in 11 regional offices and headquarters in Washington, DC. EXAMS' mission is to protect investors, ensure market integrity, and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused strategies that: improve compliance, prevent fraud, monitor risk, and inform policy.\n\nDuring examinations, the staff will seek to determine whether the entity being examined is: conducting its activities in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules adopted under these laws (as well as, where applicable, the rules of self-regulatory organizations subject to the Commission's oversight); adhering to the disclosures it has made to its clients, customers, the general public, and/or the Commission; and implementing supervisory systems and/or compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the entity's operations are in compliance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nThe staff appreciates each entity's cooperation as it will facilitate the staff's ability to timely complete the examination. Entities should work promptly to provide the staff with complete and accurate information and ensure that knowledgeable employees are made available to help the staff better understand the entity and its operations.\n\n**II.****THE EXAMINATION PROCESS**\n\nThe Commission's examination program is risk-based. An entity may be selected for examination for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, a statutory mandate that requires the Commission to examine the entity; the entity's risk profile; a tip, complaint, or referral; or a review of a particular compliance risk area. The reason an entity has been selectedfor examination is non-public information and typically will not be shared with the entity under examination. As part of the pre-examination planning process, the staff strives to efficiently allocate resources and minimize, if possible, any overlap with the scope of any recent or ongoing examinations or investigations by other regulators or Commission staff in other Commission offices or divisions. If an entity has any concerns with respect to overlapping examinations or investigations, the entity should contact the Commission staff involved.\n\nThroughout the examination process, the staff may consult and/or coordinate with other Commission staff, including supervisory examination staff and staff in other Commission offices and divisions, regarding any issues identified and the interpretation and application of the securities laws and rules adopted under these laws, and, as applicable, self-regulatory organization rules. As a result, the staff may share information and documents received from the entity with other Commission staff to the extent the staff deems necessary or appropriate. The Commission may also share information and documents with other regulators or authorities. Whether the Commission has shared information and documents received from an entity is a confidential matter. These and other possible uses of information and documents provided to the staff are described in the Commission's Form 1661, which is provided to entities at the outset of an examination and may be accessed at www.sec.gov/files/sec1661.pdf. The staff does not accept limitations on these routine uses. Similarly, when an entity or its service provider requires acceptance of terms and conditions to access websites, applications, or other systems that contain the entity's books and records, any action taken by the staff purportedly agreeing to such terms and conditions, including clicking an \""accept\"" button, will not constitute an acceptance of the terms or conditions and will not bind the staff or the Commission in contract.\n\nExaminations may be conducted on an announced or unannounced basis. When the examination is announced, the staff typically phones the entity's Chief Compliance Officer or regulatory personnel and follows up with a letter notifying the entity of the examination and requesting information, including documents, that the staff will review as part of the examination. These information requests are generally transmitted through secure email. Information regarding data delivery and the use of secure email and file transfer are available at www.sec.gov/exams. While the staff cannot comment on the specific safeguards that the Commission takes to protect non-public information, the protection of non-public information, including documents and information provided by entities during examinations, is of the utmost importance to EXAMS. When the examination is unannounced, the staff may provide the entity with a request for information, including documents, upon arrival and may conduct an initial interview. In most instances, the staff will request that information and documents be provided in electronic format via secure transmission by a specified date. For any records that cannot be produced in electronic format, the entity should promptly make such records available for examination in another manner. The Commission expects that in most circumstances records should be available to staff within 24 hours; however, the staff typically provides a longer period of time to produce records. The staff will grant requests for reasonable extensions of time, where appropriate. In all cases, the timely production of the requested information and documents will facilitate the staff's efficient completion of the examination.\n\nThe staff will typically request meetings (in person, by telephone, or by videoconference) with entity employees to discuss the entity's operations and the information and documents provided. The entity should make knowledgeable employees or other knowledgeable persons available to participate in the meetings. These meetings help the staff gain a better understanding of the entity's activities and compliance processes. During on-site meetings, the staff may ask for a tour of the entity's offices to gain an overall understanding of the entity's organization, flow of work, and control environment. For videoconferences, meeting participants are encouraged to use their cameras and to use screen-sharing functions when helpful. In some circumstances, the staff may make unannounced and unscheduled visits to the entity's offices. When scheduling meetings with the staff, the entity's cooperation will facilitate the examination.\n\nAs the staff reviews information and documents the entity has provided, the staff may make supplemental requests for information and documents. Throughout the examination, the entity should communicate promptly to the staff any questions or concerns regarding the documents and information that have been requested. Entities are encouraged to keep the staff informed of any relevant changes that occur during the examination, including any actions the entity has taken or plans to take to address any issues discussed with the staff. Although some examinations may initially be conducted by telephone or videoconference, the staff may decide at any point during the examination to conduct an on-site visit.\n\nThe staff may also request relevant information and documents held by third-party service providers or agents (including custodians) that, for example, perform work for, or in conjunction with, the entity, or whose activities may have a material effect on the entity's operations. The staff may send such requests to the entity or directly to the third-party service provider or agent. In addition, the staff often contacts the entity's clients, customers, or other knowledgeable persons, as necessary, to gather and/or verify relevant information.\n\nOnce interviews with entity personnel have been completed, or at any time it is deemed reasonable to do so, the staff may conduct a preliminary exit conference with the entity to discuss the examination status, including any outstanding requests for information, and, if appropriate, to raise any issues identified up to that point during the examination. The entity may be given an opportunity to discuss the issues that the staff has raised and provide additional relevant information. Communications from the staff do not, and are not intended to, constitute legal advice.\n\n## III. COMPLETING AN EXAMINATION\n\nAfter the staff has completed its interviews and analyses, the staff typically conducts an exit conference with the entity to discuss any issues identified during the examination. The entity will typically be given an opportunity to discuss any of the issues that the staff has raised during the examination and provide additional relevant information, including any actions that the entity has taken or plans to take to address the issues raised. In connection with any form of exit conference, the staff may speak with the entity's senior management and/or its board of directors.\n\nSection 4E(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the staff to provide the entity being examined or inspected with written notification indicating either that the examination or inspection has concluded, has concluded without findings, or that the staff requests the entity undertake corrective action, within 180 days from the later of the completion of the on-site portion (if applicable) of the examination or inspection or the receipt of all records requested from the entity being examined or inspected. For certain complex examinations, the examination deadline may be extended for an additional 180-day period without notification to the entity.\n\nNone of these outcomes forecloses the Commission from taking any action, including but not limited to an enforcement action, against the entity. Even if the staff's written notification does not address a particular activity, that does not mean that all of an entity's activities comply with the federal securities laws.\n\nGenerally, the staff will provide an entity with written notification of an examination's completion by sending a deficiency letter. In addition to sending the entity a deficiency letter, the staff may refer the issues to the Commission's Division of Enforcement, a self-regulatory organization, state regulatory agency, or others, including criminal authorities, for possible action. The staff may sometimes make a referral to the Division of Enforcement without conducting an exit conference or sending a deficiency letter, usually in exigent circumstances.\n\nThe entity will be asked to respond in writing to any issues identified in a deficiency letter, including any steps that it has taken or intends to take to address the issues and to prevent their recurrence. The entity's response will generally be due within 30 days of the date of the deficiency letter and should address all of the issues identified in the deficiency letter. An entity's submission of a timely and complete response to a deficiency letter will expedite the staff's completion of the examination.\n\nIf the staff has comments on an entity's response, the staff generally will either provide them to the entity within 60 days of receipt of the entity's response, or contact the entity within the 60-day period to discuss when the staff will be able to provide comments. If the staff has no further comments after receiving an entity's response to a deficiency letter, the examination will be closed. This does not mean, however, that the staff concurs with the entity's response. The staff generally does not return records produced during an examination. The staff conducts a limited number of follow-up reviews to determine whether entities have taken the corrective actions discussed in their responses.\n\n## 4 Questions, Concerns, and Verification of Staff Identity\n\nQuestions, comments, complaints, or concerns arising during or after an examination, can be raised with the staff or with their supervisors in the respective regional office or headquarters. Most questions and issues can be resolved by discussing them with the staff. Comments, complaints, or concerns can also be communicated through the _Examination Hotline_ (202.551.EXAM or examhotline@sec.gov). The _Examination Hotline_ provides the option to speak with either an attorney in the Division of Examinations in Washington, DC, or staff in the Commission's Office of Inspector General. The Office of Inspector General is an independent office within the Commission that audits Commission programs and investigates allegations of employee misconduct. Persons speaking with staff on the _Examination Hotline_ may identify themselves or request anonymity.\n\nFor all examinations, staff will identify themselves and will present their Commission credentials upon request. The identity of staff can be confirmed through the _Examination Hotline_.\n\n## 5 Information Regarding the Commission's Office of the Whistleblower\n\nCongress authorized the Commission to provide monetary awards to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily come forward with high-quality, original information that leads to a successful Commission enforcement action in which the Commission obtains monetary sanctions totaling more than $1,000,000. The range for awards is between 10% and 30% of the monetary sanctions collected in the Commission action or in a related action upon which the award is based. A \""whistleblower\"" is an individual who voluntarily provides original information in writing to the Commission about a possible violation of the federal securities laws that has occurred, is ongoing, or is about to occur. To be eligible for an award based on any information provided by the whistleblower that relates to a possible violation of the federal securities laws, the whistleblower must comply with the procedures and the conditions described in Rule 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One of those procedures, among others, specifies that a whistleblower must provide the information to the Commission on Form TCR or through the Commission's online TCR portal and sign the required declaration. One of the conditions, among others, is that the whistleblower' submission must be voluntary. Information is provided \""voluntarily\"" if it is provided before a request, inquiry, or demand that relates to the subject matter of the submission is directed to the whistleblower or a representative (i) by the Commission; (ii) in connection with an investigation, inspection, or examination by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or any self-regulatory organization; or (iii) in connection with an investigation by the Congress, any other authority of the federal government, or a state Attorney General or securities regulatory authority. A whistleblower must be an individual, providing information alone or jointly with others. A company or other entity cannot be a whistleblower. A person is not required to be an employee of an entity to submit information about that entity.\n\nThe Commission's Office of the Whistleblower administers the whistleblower program. Additional information about the program, including how to submit a tip under the program, is available at www.sec.gov/whistleblower. The Office of the Whistleblower may be reached at 202.551.4790.","2023 Government forms

Conditions precedent to the underwriters' taking the securities, including market outs, need not be described except in the case of an agency or best efforts arrangement._\n2. _It is not necessary to disclose each member of a selling group.

If an issuer must provide the disclosure described in Item 9(c) the use of proceeds and plan of operations should be consistent._\n\n_5.   If any material amounts of other funds are to be used in conjunction with the proceeds, state the amounts and sources of such other funds and whether such funds are firm or contingent._\n\n_6.   If any material part of the proceeds is to be used to discharge indebtedness, describe the material terms of such indebtedness.

Description of Business**\n\n(a) Narrative description of business.\n\n(1) Describe the business done and intended to be done by the issuer and its subsidiaries and the general development of the business during the past three years or such shorter period as the issuer may have been in business.

Examples of factors that might be discussed include dependence on one or a few major customers or suppliers- ers (including suppliers of raw materials or financing), effect of existing or probable governmental regulation (including environmental regulation), material terms of and/or expiration of material labor contracts or patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions or royalty agreements, unusual competitive conditions in the industry, cyclicality of the industry and anticipated raw material or energy shortages to the extent management may not be able to secure a continuing source of supply.\n\n(b) [Reserved]\n\n(c) Industry Guides. The disclosure guidelines in all Securities Act Industry Guides must be followed. To the extent that the industry guides are codified into Regulation S-K, the Regulation S-K industry disclosure items must be followed.\n\n(d) For offerings of limited partnership or limited liability company interests, an issuer must comply with the Commission's interpretive views on substantive disclosure requirements set forth in Securities Act Release No.\n\n6900 (June 17, 1991).\n\n\n\n**Item 8.Description of Property**\n\n(a)   State briefly the location and general character of any principal plants or other material physical properties of the issuer and its subsidiaries.

Information provided also must relate to the segment information of the issuer. Provide the information specified below as well as such other information that is necessary for an investor's understanding of the issuer's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations.\n\n(a)   Operating results. Provide information regarding significant factors, including unusual or infrequent events or transactions or new developments, materially affecting the issuer's income from operations, and, in each case, indicating the extent to which income was so affected. Describe any other significant component of rev- enue or expenses necessary to understand the issuer's results of operations. To the extent that the financial state- ments disclose material changes in net sales or revenues, provide a narrative discussion of the extent to which such changes are attributable to changes in prices or to changes in the volume or amount of products or services being sold or to the introduction of new products or services.\n\n_Instruction to Item 9(a):_\n\n_1.   The discussion and analysis shall focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that would cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This would include descriptions and amounts of (A) matters that would have an impact on future operations that have not had an impact in the past, and (B) matters that have had an impact on reported operations that are not expected to have an impact upon future operations._\n\n_2.   Where the consolidated financial statements reveal material changes from year to year in one or more line items, the causes for the changes shall be described to the extent necessary to an understanding of the issuer's businesses as a whole. If the causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line items, no repetition is required and a line-by-line analysis of the financial statements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. Issuers need not recite the amounts of changes from year to year which are readily computable from the financial statements. The discussion must not merely repeat numerical data contained in the consoli- dated financial statements._\n\n_3.   When interim period financial statements are included, discuss any material changes in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. Discuss any material changes in the issuer's results of operations with respect to the most recent fiscal year-to-date period forwhich a statement of comprehensive income (or statement of net income if comprehensive income is presented in two separate but consecutive financial statements or if no other comprehensive income) is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year._\n\n(b)   Liquidity and capital resources. Provide information regarding the following:\n\n(1)   the issuer's liquidity (both short and long term), including a description and evaluation of the internal and external sources of liquidity and a brief discussion of any material unused sources of liquidity. If a material deficiency in liquidity is identified, indicate the course of action that the issuer has taken or proposes to take to remedy the deficiency.\n\n(2)   the issuer's material commitments for capital expenditures as of the end of the latest fiscal year and any subsequent interim period and an indication of the general purpose of such commitments and the anticipat- ed sources of funds needed to fulfill such commitments.\n\n(c)   Plan of Operations. Issuers (including predecessors) that have not received revenue from operations during each of the three fiscal years immediately before the filing of the offering statement (or since inception, which- ever is shorter) must describe, if formulated, their plan of operation for the 12 months following the commence- ment of the proposed offering. If such information is not available, the reasons for its unavailability must be stated. Disclosure relating to any plan must include, among other things, a statement indicating whether, in the issuer's opinion, the proceeds from the offering will satisfy its cash requirements or whether it anticipates it will be necessary to raise additional funds in the next six months to implement the plan of operations.\n\n(d)   Trend information. The issuer must identify the most significant recent trends in production, sales and inventory, the state of the order book and costs and selling prices since the latest financial year. The issuer also must discuss, for at least the current financial year, any known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the issuer's net sales or revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition.\n\n**Item 10.**  **Directors, Executive Officers and Significant Employees**\n\n(a)   For each of the directors, persons nominated or chosen to become directors, executive officers, persons cho- sen to become executive officers, and significant employees, provide the information specified below in substantially the following tabular format:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l} \\hline \\hline Name & Position & Age & Term of Office(1) & Approximate hours per \\\\  & & & & week for part-time \\\\  & & & & employees(2) \\\\ \\hline Executive Officers: & & & & \\\\ \\hline Directors: & & & & \\\\ \\hline Significant Employees: & & & & \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\n(1)   Provide the month and year of the start date and, if applicable, the end date.

If it does so, the issuer should mark the exhibit index to indicate that portions of the exhibit have been omitted and include a prominent statement on the first page of the redacted exhibit that certain identified information has been excluded from the exhibit because it is both not material and is the type that the registrant treats as private or confidential. The issuer also must include brackets indicating where the information is omitted from the filed version of the exhibit. If requested by the Commission or its staff, the issuer must promptly provide on a supplemental basis an unredacted copy of the exhibit and its materiality and privacy or confidentiality analyses. Upon evaluation of the issuer's supplemental materials, the Commission or its staff may require the issuer to amend its filing to include in the exhibit any previously redacted information that is not adequately supported by the issuer's analyses. The issuer may request confidential treatment of the supplemental material submitted under paragraphs 6 or 7 pursuant to Rule 83 ($ 200.83 of this chapter) while it is in the possession of the Commission or its staff. After completing its review of the supplemental information, the Commission or its staff will return or destroy it if the registrant complies with the procedures outlined in Rule 418 ($230.418 of this chapter)._\n\n## 12 Signatures\n\nPursuant to the requirements of Regulation A, the issuer certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets all of the requirements for filing on Form 1-A and has duly caused this offering statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of, State of, on (date).\n\n(Exact name of issuer as specified in its charter)\n\nBy (Signature and Title)\n\nThis offering statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated.\n\n(Signature)\n\n(Title)\n\n(Date)\n\n_Instructions to Signatures:_\n\n_1.

If the issuer is a Canadian company, such financial statements must be prepared in accordance with either US GAAP or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). If the financial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB, such compliance must be explicitly and unreservedly stated in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements included pursuant to this item may be condensed, unaudited, and are not required to be reviewed.

However, the reference in Rule 3-10(a) of Regulation S-X to \""an issuer or guarantor of a guaranteed security that is registered or being registered is required to file financial statements required by Regulation S-X with respect to the guarantee or guaranteed security\"" instead refers to \""an issuer or guarantor of a guaranteed security that is qualified or being qualified pursuant to Regulation A is required to file financial statements required by Item 3 of Form 1-SA with respect to the guarantee or guaranteed security.\"" The definition of \""parent company\"" is the same as in Rule 3-10(b)(1) of Regulation S-X, except that Rule 3-10(b)(1)(ii) instead reads as follows: \""Is, or as a result of the subject offering statement will be, required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Rule 257(b) of Regulation A (SSSS 230.251-230.263), or is an Exchange Act reporting company.\"" The parent company must also provide the disclosures required by Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X.

Disclosures about an issuer's affiliates whose securities collateralize any class of securities being offered must be provided as required by Rule 13-02 of Regulation S-X. The issuer may elect to provide these disclosures in a footnote to its consolidated financial statements or alternatively, in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations described in Item 1 of Form 1-SA.\n\n(f) Financial Statements of Guaranttors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities.

Rules as to Use of Form 1-U.**\n\n(1) This Form shall be used for current reports pursuant to Rule 257(b)(4) of Regulation A (SSSS 230.251-230.263).\n\n(2) A report on this Form is required to be filed, as applicable, upon the occurrence of any one or more of the events specified in Items 1 - 9 of this Form. Unless otherwise specified, a report is to be filed within four business days after occurrence of the event. If the event occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which the Commission is not open for business, then the four business day period shall begin to run on, and include, the first business day thereafter.\n\n(3) If the issuer previously has provided substantially the same information as required by this Form in a report required by Rule 257(b) of Regulation A, the issuer need not make an additional report of the information on this Form. To the extent that an item calls for disclosure of developments concerning a previously reported event or transaction, any information required in the new report or amendment about the previously reported event or transaction may be provided by incorporation by reference to the previously filed report, if a hyperlink to such report as filed with the Commission is included.\n\n(4) Copies of agreements, amendments or other documents or instruments are not required to be filed as exhibits to the Form 1-U unless specifically required by the applicable item. This instruction does not affect the requirement to otherwise file such agreements, amendments or other documents or instruments, including as exhibits to offering statements and periodic reports pursuant to the requirements of Regulation A.\n\n### Preparation of Report.\n\n(1) Regulation A contains certain general requirements which are applicable to reports on any form, including amendments to reports. These general requirements should be carefully read and observed in the preparation and filing of reports on this Form.\n\n(2) This Form is not to be used as a blank form to be filled in, but only as a guide in the preparation of the report. Nevertheless, the report shall contain the number and caption of each applicable item, but the text of such item may be omitted. All items that are not required to be answered in a particular report may be omitted and no reference thereto need be made in the report. All instructions should also be omitted.\n\n(3) In addition to the information expressly required to be included in this Form, there shall be added such further material information, if any, as may be necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.\n\n### Signature and Filing of Report.\n\n(1) The report must be filed with the Commission in electronic format by means of the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System (\""EDGAR\"") in accordance with the EDGAR rules set forth in Regulation S-T (17 CFR Part 232).\n\n(2) The report must be signed by an officer duly authorized to sign on behalf of the issuer. The report must be signed using a typed signature. The signatory to the filing must also manually sign a signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or otherwise adopting his or her signature that appears in the filing. Such document must be executed before or at the time the filing is made and must be retained by the issuer for a period of five years. Upon request, the issuer must furnish to the Commission or its staff a copy of any or all documents retained pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n### Incorporation by Reference and Cross-Referencing.\n\n(1) An issuer may incorporate by reference to other documents previously submitted or filed on EDGAR. Cross-referencing within the report is also encouraged to avoid repetition of information. For example, you may respond to an item of this Form by providing a cross-reference to the location of the information in another item, instead of repeating such information. Descriptions of where the information incorporated by reference or cross-referenced can be found must be specific and must clearly identify the relevant document and portion thereof where such information can be found. For exhibits incorporated by reference, this description must be noted in the exhibits index for each relevant exhibit. All such descriptions of where information incorporated by reference can be found must be accompanied by a separate hyperlink to the incorporated document on EDGAR. A hyperlink need not remain active after the filing of the report, except that amendments to the report must update any hyperlinks referred to in the amendment that are inactive.\n\n(2) Reference may not be made to any document if the portion of such document containing the pertinent information includes an incorporation by reference to another document. Incorporation by reference to documents not available on EDGAR is not permitted. Information shall not be incorporated by reference or cross-referenced in any case where such incorporation would render the statement or report incomplete, unclear, or confusing. Incorporating information into any financial statements from elsewhere is not permitted.\n\n(3) If any substantive modification has occurred in the text of any document incorporated by reference since such document was filed, the issuer must file with the reference a statement containing the text and date of such modification.\n\n## Information to be included in the report\n\n### Item 1. Fundamental Changes\n\n(a) If the issuer has entered into or terminated a material definitive agreement that has resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a fundamental change to the nature of its business or plan of operations, disclose the following information to the extent applicable:\n\n(1) the date on which the agreement was entered into, amended, or terminated, the identity of the parties to the agreement or amendment, and a brief description of any material relationship between the issuer or its affiliates and any of the parties (other than the relationship created by the material definitive agreement or amendment);\n\n(2) a brief description of the material terms and conditions of the agreement;\n\n(3) a brief description of the material circumstances surrounding the termination; and\n\n(4) any material early termination penalties incurred by the issuer due to a termination.\n\n(b) For purposes of this item, a material definitive agreement means an agreement that provides for obligations that are material to and enforceable against the issuer, or rights that are material to the issuer and enforceable by the issuer against one or more other parties to the agreement, in each case whether or not subject to conditions.\n\n(c) File any material definitive agreement disclosed pursuant to this item as an exhibit to the report on this Form.\n\n### Instructions to Item 1:\n\n_1. A material definitive agreement that is not made in the ordinary course of business is not necessarily required to be disclosed under this item if it does not result in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, a fundamental change to the nature of the issuer's business or plan of operations._\n\n_2. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and solely for the purposes of this Item 1, a material definitive agreement is deemed to result in a fundamental change if it involves any of the following:_\n\n_a. An acquisition transaction for which the purchase price, as defined by U.S. GAAP or IFRS, exceeds fifty-percent of the total consolidated assets of the issuer as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. If the acquire transferred assets to the acquiree than the carrying value of those assets should be excluded from the purchase price;_\n\n_b. A merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar transaction that requires approval by the issuer's securityholders; or_Any contract upon which the issuer's business is substantially dependent, as in the case of continuing contracts to sell the major part of the issuer's products or services or to purchase the major part of the issuer's requirements of goods, services or raw materials or any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which the issuer's business is substantially dependent.\n3. An issuer must provide disclosure under this item if the issuer succeeds as a party to the agreement or amendment to the agreement by assumption or assignment (other than in connection with a merger or acquisition or similar transaction that is otherwise reported pursuant to this item).\n4. No disclosure under this item is required regarding the termination of a material definitive agreement if: 1. The agreement terminated on its stated termination date, or as a result of all parties completing their obligations under such agreement. Only negotiations or discussions regarding termination of a material definitive agreement are being conducted and the agreement has not been terminated.\n\nThe issuer believes in good faith that the material definitive agreement has not been terminated, unless the issuer has received a notice of termination pursuant to the terms of agreement.\n\n**Item 2.** **Bankruptcy or Receivership**\n\n(a) If a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer has been appointed for an issuer or its parent, in a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or in any other proceeding under state, federal, or Canadian laws, in which a court or governmental authority has assumed jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business of the issuer or its parent, or if such jurisdiction has been assumed by leaving the existing directors and officers in possession but subject to the supervision and orders of a court or governmental authority, disclose the following information:\n\n(1) the name or other identification of the proceeding;\n\n(2) the identity of the court or governmental authority;\n\n(3) the date that jurisdiction was assumed; and\n\n(4) the identity of the receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer and the date of his or her appointment.\n\n(b) If an order confirming a plan of reorganization, arrangement or liquidation has been entered by a court or governmental authority having supervision or jurisdiction over substantially all of the assets or business of the issuer or its parent, disclose the following:\n\n(1) the identity of the court or governmental authority;\n\n(2) the date that the order confirming the plan was entered by the court or governmental authority;\n\n(3) a summary of the material features of the plan;\n\n(4) the number of shares or other units of the issuer or its parent issued and outstanding, the number reserved for future issuance in respect of claims and interests filed and allowed under the plan, and the aggregate total of such numbers; and\n\n(5) information as to the assets and liabilities of the issuer or its parent as of the date that the order confirming the plan was entered, or a date as close thereto as practicable.\n\n_Instruction to Item 2:_\n\n_The information called for in paragraph (b)(5) of this item may be presented in the form in which it was furnished to the court or governmental authority._\n\n**Item 3.** **Material Modification to Rights of Securityholders**\n\n(a) If the constituent instruments defining the rights of the holders of any class of securities of the issuer that were issued pursuant to Regulation A have been materially modified, disclose the date of the modification, the title of the class of securities involved and briefly describe the general effect of such modification upon the rights of holders of such securities.\n\n(b) If the rights or benefits evidenced by any class of securities issued pursuant to Regulation A have been materially limited or qualified by the issuance or modification of any other class of securities by the issuer, briefly disclose the date of the issuance or modification, the general effect of the issuance or modification of such other class of securities upon the rights or benefits of the holders of the securities issued pursuant to Regulation A.\n\n_Instruction to Item 3:_\n\n_Working capital restrictions and other limitations upon the payment of dividends must be reported pursuant to this item._\n\n**Item 4.** **Changes in Issuer's Certifying Accountant**\n\n(a) If an independent accountant who was previously engaged as the principal accountant to audit the issuer's financial statements, or an independent accountant upon whom the principal accountant expressed reliance in its report regarding a significant subsidiary, resigns (or indicates that it declines to stand for re-appointment after completion of the current audit) or is dismissed, disclose the information that would be required under Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.304(a)(1)), including compliance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.304(a)(3)) if the issuer were a \""registrant.\""\n\n(b) If a new independent accountant has been engaged as either the principal accountant to audit the issuer's financial statements or as an independent accountant on whom the principal accountant is expected to express reliance in its report regarding a significant subsidiary, the issuer must disclose the information that would be required by Item 304(a)(2) of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.304(a)(2)) if the issuer were a \""registrant.\""\n\n_Instructions to Item 4:_\n\n_1. Information under this Item 4 is only required if the issuer \\(\\lx@sectionsign\\) most recent qualified offering statement on Form 1-A or report on Form 1-K, whichever is most recent, contains audited financial statements._\n\n_2. The resignation or dismissal of an independent accountant, or its refusal to stand for re-appointment, is a reportable event separate from the engagement of a new independent accountant. On some occasions, two reports on Form 1-U are required for a single change in accountants, the first on the resignation (or refusal to stand for re-appointment) or dismissal of the former accountant and the second when the new accountant is engaged. Information required in the second Form 1-U filing in such situations need not be provided to the extent that it has been reported previously in the first Form 1-U filing._\n\n**Item 5. Non-reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review**\n\n(a) If the issuer's board of directors, a committee of the board of directors or the officer or officers of the issuer authorized to take such action if board action is not required, concludes that any previously issued financial statements, covering one or more years or interim periods for which the issuer is required to provide financial statements under Regulation A, including Form 1-A, should no longer be relied upon because of an error in such financial statements as addressed in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 250 or IAS 8, as may be modified, supplemented or succeeded, disclose the following information:\n\n(1) the date of the conclusion regarding the non-reliance and an identification of the financial statements and years or periods covered that should no longer be relied upon;\n\n(2) a brief description of the facts underlying the conclusion to the extent known to the issuer at the time of filing;\n\nand\n\n(3) a statement of whether the audit committee, or the board of directors in the absence of an audit committee, or authorized officer or officers, discussed with the issuer's independent accountant the matters disclosed in the filing pursuant to this paragraph (a).\n\n(b) If the issuer is advised by, or receives notice from, its independent accountant that disclosure should be made or action should be taken to prevent future reliance on a previously issued audit report or completed interim review related to previously issued financial statements, disclose the following information:\n\n(1) the date on which the issuer was so advised or notified;\n\n(2) identification of the financial statements that should no longer be relied upon;\n\n(3) a brief description of the information provided by the accountant; and\n\n(4) a statement of whether the audit committee, or the board of directors in the absence of an audit committee, or authorized officer or officers, discussed with the independent accountant the matters disclosed in the filing pursuant to paragraph (b) of this item.\n\n(c) If the issuer receives advisement or notice from its independent accountant requiring disclosure under paragraph (b) of this item, the issuer must:\n\n(1) provide the independent accountant with a copy of the disclosures the issuer is making in response to this item and the independent accountant shall receive a copy no later than the day that the disclosures are filed with the Commission;\n\n(2) request the independent accountant to furnish to the issuer as promptly as possible a letter addressed to the Commission stating whether the independent accountant agrees with the statements made by the issuer in response to this item and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree; and (3) amend the issuer's previously filed Form 1-U by filing the independent accountant's letter as an exhibit to the filed Form 1-U no later than two business days after the issuer's receipt of the letter.\n\n**Item 6.**\n\n**Changes in Control of Issuer**\n\n(a) If, to the knowledge of the issuer's board of directors, a committee of the board of directors, governing body similar to a board of directors, or authorized officer or officers of the issuer, a change in control of the issuer has occurred, furnish the following information:\n\n(1) the identity of the persons who acquired such control;\n\n(2) the date and a description of the transactions which resulted in the change in control;\n\n(3) the basis of the control, including the percentage of voting securities of the issuer now beneficially owned directly or indirectly by the persons who acquired control;\n\n(4) the amount of the consideration used by such persons;\n\n(5) the sources of funds used by the persons, unless all or any part of the consideration used is a loan made in the ordinary course of business by a bank as defined by Section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\n(6) the identity of the persons from whom control was assumed; and\n\n(7) any arrangements or understandings among members of both the former and new control groups and their associates with respect to election of directors or other matters.\n\n(b) Describe any arrangements, known to the issuer, including any pledge by any person of securities of the issuer or any of its parents, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the issuer.

If there is no such agreement, the issuer must provide the disclosure within four business days after the occurrence of the closing or settlement of the transaction or arrangement under which the equity securities are to be sold.\n\n(b) No report need be filed if the equity securities sold, in the aggregate since its last report filed under this item or its last periodic report containing such disclosure, whichever is more recent, constitute less than 10% of the number of shares outstanding of the class of equity securities sold.\n\n_Instructions to Item 8:_\n\n_1.
