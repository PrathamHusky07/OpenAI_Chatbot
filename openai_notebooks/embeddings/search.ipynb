    "INFORMATION FOR ENTITIES SUBJECT TO  EXAMINATION OR INSPECTION BY  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION      The examination staff (staf f) of the Division  of Examinations ( EXAMS ) of the Securities and  Exchange Commission (Commission) has prepared this brochure to provide information  about examinations it conduct s, including  information about the examination process and  the methods the staff employ s for resolving issues identified d uring examinations.. This  information, provided to entities undergoing examination or inspection , should help entities  to understand better the  staff’s objectives in this area.1    I.. PURPOSE OF EXAMINATIONS   Commission representatives have statutory authority  to conduct , at any time or from time to  time, reasonable periodic, special , and other examinations of the records of specified  Commission -regulated entities  (entity  or entities ).. The s taff carries out these responsibilities in   11 regional offices and headquarters  in Washington, DC.. EXAMS ’ mission  is to protect  investors, ensure market integrity, and support responsible capital formation through risk-focused  strategies that: improve compliance , prevent fraud , monitor risk , and inform policy.. During exam inations, the staff will seek to determine whether the entity being examined is :  conducting its activities in accordance with the federal securities laws and the rules adopted  under these laws ( as well as , where applicable, the rules of self-regulatory organizations subject  to the Commission ’s oversight); adhering to the disclosures it has made to  its clients, customers ,  the general public, and /or the Commission ; and implementing supervisory systems and/or  compliance policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the entity ’s  operations are in compliance with applicable legal requirements .. The staff  appreciates each entity ’s cooperation as it will facilitate the staff ’s ability to time ly  complete the examination .. Entities should work promptly to  provide the staff  with complete and  accurate information and ensure that knowledgeable employees are made available to  help the  staff better understand the entity and its operations.. II.. THE EXAMINATION PROCESS   The Commission ’s exam ination  program is risk -based .. An entity may be selected for  examination for any number of reasons including , but not limited to,  a statutory mandate that  requires the Commission to examine the entity ; the entity ’s risk profile; a tip, complaint, or  referral; or a review of a particular compliance risk area.. The reason an entity has been selected                                                    1  This statement represents the views of staff of EXAMS.. It is not a rule, regulation, or statement of the  Commission.. The Commission has neither approved nor disapproved its content.. This statement, like all staff  statements, has no legal force or effect: it does not alter or amend applicable law, and it creates no new or additi onal  obligations for any person.. SEC 2389 ( 03-23) -2- for examination is non-public information and typically will not be shared with the entity under  examination .. As part of the pre -examination planning process, the staff  strives to efficiently   allocate resources and minimize , if possible, any  overlap with the scope of any recent or ongoing  examinations or investigations by other regulators or Commission staff  in other Commission  offices or divisions.. If an entity has any concerns with respect to overlapping examinations or investigations , the entity should contact the Commission staff  involved.. Throughout the examination process, the staff  may consult and/or coordinate with other  Commission staff, including supervisory examination staff and staff in other Commission offices and divisions, regarding any issues identified and  the interpretation  and application of the  securities laws and rules adopted under these laws, and, as  applicable, self -regulatory  organization rules.. As a result, the staff may share information and documents received from the  entity with other Commission staff to the extent the staff  deems necessary or appropriate.. The  Commission may also share information and documents with other regulators or authorities.. Whether the Commission has shared information and documents received from an entity is a confidential matter..\n",
